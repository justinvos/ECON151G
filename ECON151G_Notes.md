# ECON 151G Notes

## Preliminary Concepts

**Economics** is the study of hwo individuals and societies choose to use the scarce resources that nature and previous generations have provided.

**Scare resources**:
- Labour (Skilled and unskilled)
- Land (Includes everything natural)
- Capital (Tools)
- Entreprenuers

**Scarcity** is the idea that consumers have unlimited wants and only limited means to obtain them.

**Opportunity cost** is the best alternative that we give up when we make a choice or decision.

**Marginalism** is the idea of weighing only the costs and benefits of an additional decision and ignoring any sunk costs.

**Sunk costs** are costs that cannot be avoided and therefore should not be taken into account.

An **efficient market** is one in which profit opportunities are taken advantage of immediately.

**Microeconomics** is the branch of economics that examines the functioning of individual industries and the behaviour of individual decision-making units.

**Macroeconomics** is the branch of economics that examines the economics behaviour of aggregates on a national scale.

## Demand and Supply

A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.

**Goods** are tangible.
**Services** are intangible.

### Demand

**Demand** is a measure of how willing buyers are to purchase a good or service.

The **Law of Demand** states that there is an inverse relationship between price and the quantity demanded.

A **demand schedule** is a table which lists the prices and the quantity demanded for a good.

A **demand curve** is a graph of the prices and the quantity demanded for a good.

**Market demand** is the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.

**Ceteris paribus** is a Latin phrase that means "all other things being equal".

The **determinants of demand** include:
* Tastes and fashion
* Income
* Price of relating goods (complements and substitutes)
* Size and nature of population

A **normal good** has a proportional relationship with income.

An **inferior good** has an inversely proportional relationship with income.

Two goods are **substitutes** if a rise in the price of one increases demand for the other.

Two goods are **complements** is a rise in the price of one decreases demand for the other.

### Supply

**Supply** is a measure of how willing sellers are to produce a good or service.

The **Law of Supply** states that there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

A **supply schedule** is a table which lists the prices and the quantity supplied for a good.

A **supply curve** is a graph of the prices and the quantity supplied for a good.

**Market supply** is the sum of all individuals supplies for all sellers of a particular good or service.

The **determinants of supply** include:
* Costs of production
* Environment
* Number of suppliers
* Technology

**Equilibrium** is the point that the market settles at to balances the quantity supplied and quantity demanded.

**Disequilibrium** is when the market does not settle at the equilibrium.

A **shortage** is when the quantity demanded is more than the quantity supplied.

A **surplus** is when the quantity supplied is more than the quantity demanded.

## Elasticity and Applications

**Elasticity** is the degree of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another.

**Total revenue** is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good. $\text{Total revenue}=P\times Q$

The **elasticity of demand** is a measure of responsiveness between the price and quantity demanded. $P_{\epsilon\ d}=\large\frac{\Delta Q}{\frac{Q_1+Q_2}{2}}\div\frac{\Delta P}{\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}}=\frac{\Delta\ \text{Quantity}}{\mu\ \text{Quantity}}\div\frac{\Delta\ \text{Price}}{\mu\ \text{Price}}$

**Elastic demand** is when a given a change in price causes a proportionally greater change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}>1$).

**Unit elastic demand** is when a given change in price causes an exactly proportional change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=1$).

**Inelastic demand** is when a given a change in price causes a proportionally lesser change in the quantity demanded ($0<P_{\epsilon d}<1$).

The **determinants of elasticity** include:
* With respect to price
  * Availability of substitute
  * Time
* With respect to income
  * Nature of the good
  * Luxury
  * Necessity

**Perfect inelasticity** is when a given change in price causes no change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=0$).

**Perfect elasticity** is when a given change in price causes an infinite change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=\infty$).

**Cross elasticity of demand** is a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a given change in the price of another good. Whether the elasticity is positive, negative or zero depends on if the other good is a substitute, complement or has no relation, respectively.

## Measuring a Nation's income

**Gross domestic product** (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. $\text{GDP}=Y=C+I+G+NX$

**Consumption** ($C$) is the spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing.

**Investment** ($I$) is the spending on capital equiptment, inventories and structures, including new housing.

**Government purchases** ($G$) is the spending on goods and services by local, state and federal governments.

**Net exports** ($NX$) is the net

**Gross National Product** (GNP) tracks down total income of all citizens of a country.

**Net Foreign Income** (NFI) is another measure of income.

**Gross National Disposable Income** $YD=Y+\text{NFI}$

**Nominal GDP** values the production of goods and services at current prices.

**Real GDP** values the production of goods and services at constant prices.

The **GDP deflator** adjusts between Nominal GDP and Real GDP. $\text{GDP deflator}=100\times\large\frac{\text{GDP}_\text{Nominal}}{\text{GDP}_\text{Real}}$

Higher GDP per person indicates a higher standard of living.

However, some things that are not included in GDP are:
* The value of leisure
* The value of a clean Environment
* The value of all activities that take place outside of markets

### Measuring the Cost of Living
**Inflation** is the situation in which the economy's overall price level is rising.

The **inflation rate** is the percentage change in the price level from the previous period.

The **consumers price index** (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of goods and services bought by a typical household.

Statistics New Zealand calculates the consumers price index each month using data on over 700 goods and services and the following steps:
1. Determine what prices are most important to the typical consumer.
2. Find the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket for each point in time.
3. Use the data on prices to calculate the cost of the basket of goods and services at different times.
4. Choose a base period and compute the index. $\text{CPI}=100\times\large\frac{\text{Price of goods and services in current year}}{\text{Price of goods and services in base year}}$
5. Calculate the inflation rate. $\text{Inflation rate}=\large\frac{CPI_\text{Year 2}-CPI_\text{Year 1}}{CPI_\text{Year 1}}$

Problems in measuring the cost of living:
* Substitution bias
* Introduction of new goods
* Unmeasured quality changes

A **price index** is used to correct for the effects of inflation when comparing dollar figures from different times. $\text{Amount in today's dollars}=\text{Amount in Year x dollars}\large\frac{\text{Price level today}}{\text{Price level in Year x}}$

When some dollar amount is automatically corrected for inflation by law or contract, the amount is said to be **indexed** for inflation.

The **cost of living allowance** (COLA) is a contract that automatically raises the wage when the consumer price index rises.

The **nominal interest rate** is the interest rate usually reported and not corrected for inflation. Quoted bank rates are nominal.

The **real interest rate** is the nominal interest rate that is corrected for the effects of inflation. $\text{Real interest rate}=\text{Nominal interest rate}-\text{Inflation}$
