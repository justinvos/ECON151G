# ECON 151G Notes

## Preliminary Concepts

**Economics** is the study of hwo individuals and societies choose to use the scarce resources that nature and previous generations have provided.

**Scare resources**:
- Labour (Skilled and unskilled)
- Land (Includes everything natural)
- Capital (Tools)
- Entreprenuers

**Scarcity** is the idea that consumers have unlimited wants and only limited means to obtain them.

**Opportunity cost** is the best alternative that we give up when we make a choice or decision.

**Marginalism** is the idea of weighing only the costs and benefits of an additional decision and ignoring any sunk costs.

**Sunk costs** are costs that cannot be avoided and therefore should not be taken into account.

An **efficient market** is one in which profit opportunities are taken advantage of immediately.

**Microeconomics** is the branch of economics that examines the functioning of individual industries and the behaviour of individual decision-making units.

**Macroeconomics** is the branch of economics that examines the economics behaviour of aggregates on a national scale.

## Demand and Supply

A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.

**Goods** are tangible.
**Services** are intangible.

### Demand

**Demand** is a measure of how willing buyers are to purchase a good or service.

The **Law of Demand** states that there is an inverse relationship between price and the quantity demanded.

A **demand schedule** is a table which lists the prices and the quantity demanded for a good.

A **demand curve** is a graph of the prices and the quantity demanded for a good.

**Market demand** is the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.

**Ceteris paribus** is a Latin phrase that means "all other things being equal".

The **determinants of demand** include:
* Tastes and fashion
* Income
* Price of relating goods (complements and substitutes)
* Size and nature of population

A **normal good** has a proportional relationship with income.

An **inferior good** has an inversely proportional relationship with income.

Two goods are **substitutes** if a rise in the price of one increases demand for the other.

Two goods are **complements** is a rise in the price of one decreases demand for the other.

### Supply

**Supply** is a measure of how willing sellers are to produce a good or service.

The **Law of Supply** states that there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

A **supply schedule** is a table which lists the prices and the quantity supplied for a good.

A **supply curve** is a graph of the prices and the quantity supplied for a good.

**Market supply** is the sum of all individuals supplies for all sellers of a particular good or service.

The **determinants of supply** include:
* Costs of production
* Environment
* Number of suppliers
* Technology

**Equilibrium** is the point that the market settles at to balances the quantity supplied and quantity demanded.

**Disequilibrium** is when the market does not settle at the equilibrium.

A **shortage** is when the quantity demanded is more than the quantity supplied.

A **surplus** is when the quantity supplied is more than the quantity demanded.

## Elasticity and Applications

**Elasticity** is the degree of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another.

**Total revenue** is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good. $\text{Total revenue}=P\times Q$

The **elasticity of demand** is a measure of responsiveness between the price and quantity demanded. $P_{\epsilon\ d}=\large\frac{\Delta Q}{\frac{Q_1+Q_2}{2}}\div\frac{\Delta P}{\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}}=\frac{\Delta\ \text{Quantity}}{\mu\ \text{Quantity}}\div\frac{\Delta\ \text{Price}}{\mu\ \text{Price}}$

**Elastic demand** is when a given a change in price causes a proportionally greater change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}>1$).

**Unit elastic demand** is when a given change in price causes an exactly proportional change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=1$).

**Inelastic demand** is when a given a change in price causes a proportionally lesser change in the quantity demanded ($0<P_{\epsilon d}<1$).

The **determinants of elasticity** include:
* With respect to price
  * Availability of substitute
  * Time
* With respect to income
  * Nature of the good
  * Luxury
  * Necessity

**Perfect inelasticity** is when a given change in price causes no change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=0$).

**Perfect elasticity** is when a given change in price causes an infinite change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=\infty$).

**Cross elasticity of demand** is a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a given change in the price of another good. Whether the elasticity is positive, negative or zero depends on if the other good is a substitute, complement or has no relation, respectively.
