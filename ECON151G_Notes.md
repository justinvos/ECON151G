# ECON 151G Notes

## Preliminary Concepts

**Economics** is the study of how individuals and societies choose to use the scarce resources that nature and previous generations have provided.

**Scare resources**:
- Labour (Skilled and unskilled)
- Land (Includes everything natural)
- Capital (Tools)
- Entreprenuers

**Scarcity** is the idea that consumers have unlimited wants and only limited means to obtain them.

**Opportunity cost** is the best alternative that we give up when we make a choice or decision.

**Marginalism** is the idea of weighing only the costs and benefits of an additional decision and ignoring any sunk costs.

**Sunk costs** are costs that cannot be avoided and therefore should not be taken into account.

An **efficient market** is one in which profit opportunities are taken advantage of immediately.

**Microeconomics** is the branch of economics that examines the functioning of individual industries and the behaviour of individual decision-making units.

**Macroeconomics** is the branch of economics that examines the economics behaviour of aggregates on a national scale.

## Demand and Supply

A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.

**Goods** are tangible.
**Services** are intangible.

### Demand

**Demand** is a measure of how willing buyers are to purchase a good or service.

The **Law of Demand** states that there is an inverse relationship between price and the quantity demanded.

A **demand schedule** is a table which lists the prices and the quantity demanded for a good.

A **demand curve** is a graph of the prices and the quantity demanded for a good.

**Market demand** is the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.

**Ceteris paribus** is a Latin phrase that means "all other things being equal".

The **determinants of demand** include:
* Tastes and fashion
* Income
* Price of relating goods (complements and substitutes)
* Size and nature of population

A **normal good** has a proportional relationship with income.

An **inferior good** has an inversely proportional relationship with income.

Two goods are **substitutes** if a rise in the price of one increases demand for the other.

Two goods are **complements** is a rise in the price of one decreases demand for the other.

### Supply

**Supply** is a measure of how willing sellers are to produce a good or service.

The **Law of Supply** states that there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

A **supply schedule** is a table which lists the prices and the quantity supplied for a good.

A **supply curve** is a graph of the prices and the quantity supplied for a good.

**Market supply** is the sum of all individuals supplies for all sellers of a particular good or service.

The **determinants of supply** include:
* Costs of production
* Environment
* Number of suppliers
* Technology

**Equilibrium** is the point that the market settles at to balances the quantity supplied and quantity demanded.

**Disequilibrium** is when the market does not settle at the equilibrium.

A **shortage** is when the quantity demanded is more than the quantity supplied.

A **surplus** is when the quantity supplied is more than the quantity demanded.

## Elasticity and Applications

**Elasticity** is the degree of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another.

**Total revenue** is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good. $\text{Total revenue}=P\times Q$

The **elasticity of demand** is a measure of responsiveness between the price and quantity demanded. $P_{\epsilon\ d}=\large\frac{\Delta Q}{\frac{Q_1+Q_2}{2}}\div\frac{\Delta P}{\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}}=\frac{\Delta\ \text{Quantity}}{\mu\ \text{Quantity}}\div\frac{\Delta\ \text{Price}}{\mu\ \text{Price}}$

**Elastic demand** is when a given a change in price causes a proportionally greater change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}>1$).

**Unit elastic demand** is when a given change in price causes an exactly proportional change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=1$).

**Inelastic demand** is when a given a change in price causes a proportionally lesser change in the quantity demanded ($0<P_{\epsilon d}<1$).

The **determinants of elasticity** include:
* With respect to price
  * Availability of substitute
  * Time
* With respect to income
  * Nature of the good
  * Luxury
  * Necessity

**Perfect inelasticity** is when a given change in price causes no change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=0$).

**Perfect elasticity** is when a given change in price causes an infinite change in the quantity demanded ($P_{\epsilon d}=\infty$).

**Cross elasticity of demand** is a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a given change in the price of another good. Whether the elasticity is positive, negative or zero depends on if the other good is a substitute, complement or has no relation, respectively.

## Measuring a Nation's income

**Gross domestic product** (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. $\text{GDP}=Y=C+I+G+NX$

**Consumption** ($C$) is the spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing.

**Investment** ($I$) is the spending on capital equiptment, inventories and structures, including new housing.

**Government purchases** ($G$) is the spending on goods and services by local, state and federal governments.

**Net exports** ($NX$) is the exports minus the imports of a nation.

**Gross National Product** (GNP) tracks down total income of all citizens of a country.

**Net Foreign Income** (NFI) is another measure of income.

**Gross National Disposable Income** $YD=Y+\text{NFI}$

**Nominal GDP** values the production of goods and services at current prices.

**Real GDP** values the production of goods and services at constant prices.

The **GDP deflator** adjusts between Nominal GDP and Real GDP. $\text{GDP deflator}=100\times\large\frac{\text{GDP}_\text{Nominal}}{\text{GDP}_\text{Real}}$

Higher GDP per person indicates a higher standard of living.

However, some things that are not included in GDP are:
* The value of leisure
* The value of a clean Environment
* The value of all activities that take place outside of markets

### Measuring the Cost of Living
**Inflation** is the situation in which the economy's overall price level is rising.

The **inflation rate** is the percentage change in the price level from the previous period.

The **consumers price index** (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of goods and services bought by a typical household.

Statistics New Zealand calculates the consumers price index each month using data on over 700 goods and services and the following steps:
1. Determine what prices are most important to the typical consumer.
2. Find the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket for each point in time.
3. Use the data on prices to calculate the cost of the basket of goods and services at different times.
4. Choose a base period and compute the index. $\text{CPI}=100\times\large\frac{\text{Price of goods and services in current year}}{\text{Price of goods and services in base year}}$
5. Calculate the inflation rate. $\text{Inflation rate}=\large\frac{CPI_\text{Year 2}-CPI_\text{Year 1}}{CPI_\text{Year 1}}$

Problems in measuring the cost of living:
* Substitution bias
* Introduction of new goods
* Unmeasured quality changes

The **GDP deflator** reflects the prices of all goods and services produced domestically and is calculated as follows $\text{GDP Deflator}=\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\times 100$.

A **price index** is used to correct for the effects of inflation when comparing dollar figures from different times. $\text{Amount in today's dollars}=\text{Amount in Year x dollars}\times\large\frac{\text{Price level today}}{\text{Price level in Year x}}$

When some dollar amount is automatically corrected for inflation by law or contract, the amount is said to be **indexed** for inflation.

The **cost of living allowance** (COLA) is a contract that automatically raises the wage when the consumer price index rises.

The **nominal interest rate** is the interest rate usually reported and not corrected for inflation. Quoted bank rates are nominal.

The **real interest rate** is the nominal interest rate that is corrected for the effects of inflation. $\text{Real interest rate}=\text{Nominal interest rate}-\text{Inflation}$

## Saving, Investment and the Financial System

The **financial system** consists of the group of institutions in the economy that help to match one person's saving with another person's investment, moving the economy's scarce resources from savers to borrowers.

Financial institutions can be grouped into two different categories:
* Financial markets
* Financial intermediaries

**Financial markets** are the institutions through which savers can directly provide funds to borrowers. E.g. share market and bond market.

**Financial intermediaries** are financial institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers. E.g. banks and managed funds

A **bond** is a certificate of indebtedness that specifies obligation of the borrower to the holder of the bond.

The **term** of a bond is the length of time until the bond matures.

The **credit risk** is the probability that the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal.

The **tax treatment** is the way in which the tax laws treat the interest on the bond.

A **share** represents a claim to partial ownership in a firm and therefore a claim to the profits the firm makes.

**Equity financing** is the sale of shares to raise money.

Compared to bonds, shares offer both higher risk and potentially higher returns.

The information in stock tables normally consists of:
* Price of the share
* Volume (number of shares sold)
* Dividends (profit paid to shareholders)
* Price-earning ratio

**Banks** take deposits from people who want to save and use the deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow.

A **medium of exchange** is an item that people can easily use to enage in transactions.

A **managed fund** is an institution that sells shares to the public and uses the procees to buy a portfolio of various types of stocks, bonds or both.

Other financial institutions:
* Credit unions
* Pension funds
* Insurance companies
* Loan sharks

**National saving** is the total disposable income in the economy that remains after paying for consumption and government purchases. $S=YD-C-G$

**Private saving** is the amount of disposable income that households have left after paying their taxes and paying for their consumption. $\text{Private saving}=YD-T-C$

**Public saving** is the amount of tax revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending. $\text{Public saving}=T-G$

In a closed economy, savings must be equal to investment. $S=I$

A **budget surplus** is when the government receives more money than it spends.

A **budget deficit** is when the government spends more money than it receives in tax revenue.

**Loanable funds** is all income that people have chosen to save and to lend out, rather than use for their own consumption.

The three government policies that affect saving and investments are:
* Changes in interest tax policies inversely shifts the supply curve
* Changes in investment tax credit policies proportionally shifts the demand curve
* Changes in government debt affects the supply of loanable funds.

## Unemployment

The **natural rate of unemployment** is unemployment that does not go away on its own even in the long run. It is the amount of unemployment the economy normally experiences.

The **cyclical rate of unemployment** is the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate. It is assocatiated with the short-term ups and downs of the business cycle.

Unemployment is measured by Statistics NZ by placing each participant of a 30,000 person survey into either the category of employed, unemployed or not in the labour force.

The **labour force** is the total number of workers, including btoh the employed and the unemployed.

The **unemployment rate** is calculated as $\text{Unemployment rate}=\frac{\text{Number of unemployed}}{\text{Labour force}}\times 100$.

The **labour force participation rate** is the percentage of the adult labour force that is in the labour force and is calculated as $\text{Labour force participation rate}=\frac{\text{Labour force}}{\text{Adult population}}\times 100$.

**Discouraged workers** are people that would like to work but have given up looking for jobs, don't show up in unemployment statistics.

**Frictional unemployment** refers to the unemployment that results from the time that is takes to match with jobs.

**Structural unemployment** is the unemployment that results because the number of jobs available in some labour markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who wants one.

**Job search** is the process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills.

The **unemployment benefit** is a government program that ensures a minimum standard of living for workers when they become unemployed.

A **union** is a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions.

**Collective bargaining** is the process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment.

A **strike** is the withdrawal of labour from the firm by the union. They are usually organised if the union and the firm cannot reach an agreement.

**Efficiency wages** are above-equilibrium wages paid by firms in order to increase worker productivity.


## The Monetary System and Inflation

**Money** is the set of assets in an economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services from other people.

A **medium of exchange** is an item that buyers give to sellers when they want to purchase goods and services. A medium of exchange is anything that is readily acceptable as payment.

A **unit of account** is the measure people use to post prices and record debts.

A **store of value** is an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future.

**Liquidity** is the ease with which an asset can be converted into the economy's medium of exchange.

**Commodity money** takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value.

**Fiat money** is used as money because of government decree and has no intrinsic value.

The **Reserve Bank of New Zealand** (RBNZ) serves as the nation's central bank. Its main objective is to ensure price stability.

The **official cash rate** (OCR) is the interest rate that banks earn on their deposit with the RBNZ as well as the interest that banks pay to borrow overnight cash from RBNZ. It is set every six weeks by the Governor of the RBNZ.

The **settlement cash balance** is the deposit that banks keep with the RBNZ as cash reserves for settling their end of day net transaction.

**Liquidity ratio** is the ratio of settlement cash to bank's assets that can be used as collateral.

**Monetary policy** refers to the measures taken to manipulate money supply.

**Reserves** are deposits that banks have received but have not loaned out.

In a **fractional-reserve baking system**, banks hold a fraction of the money deposited as reserves and lend out the rest.

The **reserve ratio** is the fraction of deposits that banks hold as reserves.

The **money multiplier** is the amount of money the banking system generates with each dollar of reserves and is calculated as $\text{Money multiplier}=\frac{1}{\text{Reserve ratio}}$.

**Open market operations** is where the RBNZ buys government bonds from or sells government bonds to the public.

The **reserve requirement** is the percentage amount of a bank's total reserves that may not be loaned out.

The **discount rate** is the interest rate the central bank charges banks for loans.

**Transactions** involve transferring money from a bank to some other.
* When the net transaction is negative, i.e. it receives less money than it pays, the bank would require more cash to settle the deficit.
* When the net transaction is positive, i.e. it receives more money than it pays, the bank could lend the surplus amount to other banks which have net demand for cash or deposit them with the RBNZ.

The RBNZ holds these surplus cash reserves of the trading banks on a special account and calls it the **settlement cash balance** (SCB). The SCB corresponds to a bank's reserve under a fractional-reserve system.

The OCR lies at the center of the band of the RBNZ interest rates for the SCB of registered banks as follows:
* Trading banks can borrow at a margin of 0.25% above the OCR.
* Trading banks can receive interest on their surplus reserves with the RBNZ at a margin 0.25% lower than the OCR.
* In addition, RBNZ sets no limit on the amount of overnight cash demanded or supplied, at the rate of 0.25% above or below the OCR.

The **optimal reserve ratio** (ORR) is the ratio of the SCB to demand deposits (DD) which can be compared with the reserve ratio that the commercial banks are required to hold in a fractional-reserve system.

The **classical theory of inflation** is that the primary cause of inflation is the growth in the quantity of money.

**Nominal variables** are variables measured in monetary units.

**Real variables** are variables measured in physical units.

**Monetary neutrality** is the irrelevance of monetary changes for real variables.

The **velocity of money** refers to the speed at which the typical dollar coin travels around the economy from wallet to wallet and can be calculated $\text{Velocity}=\frac{\text{Price level}\times \text{Output quantity}}{\text{Money quantity}}$.

The **quantity equation** is $\text{Money quantity}\times\text{Velocity}=\text{Price level}\times \text{Output quantity}$.

The **inflation rate** can be defined by: $\text{Inflation rate}=\text{Growth of money supply}-\text{Growth of real GDP}$.

**Hyperinflation** is inflation that exceeds 50% per month.

An **inflation tax** is a tax on everyone that holds money as the government prints money.

The **Fisher effect** refers to a one-to-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate.

**Shoe leather costs** are the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings.

**Menu costs** are the costs of adjusting prices.

## Open Economy Macroeconomics

A **closed economy** is one that does not interact with other economies in the world \--- there are no exports, no imports and no capital flows.

A **open economy** is one that interacts freely with other economies around the world.

**Exports** are goods and services that are produced domestically and solf abroad.

**Imports** are goods and services that are produced abroad and sold domestically.

**Net exports** (NX) are the value of a nation's exports minus the value of its imports. Net exports are also called the **trade balance**.

A **trade deficit** is a situation in which net exports are negative \--- exports are less than imports.

A **trade surplus** is a situation in which net exports are positive \--- exports are more than imports.

**Balanced trade** refers to when net exports are zero \--- exports are equal to imports.

Factors that affect net exports:
* The tastes of consumers for domestic and foreign goods.
* The prices of goods at home and abroad.
* The exchange rates at which people can use domestic currency to buy foreign currency.
* The incomes of consumers at home and abroad.
* The costs of transporting goods from country to country.
* The policies of the government toward international trade.

The **balance of payments** measures all international transactions recorded at time of change of ownership or when service performed.

The **current account** records transactions relating to:
* Merchandise trade
* Services trade
* International investment income
* Current transfers

The current account combines an imbalance between:
* A country's exports and its imports.
* A country's receipts of income and transfers from abroad.
* Its payments of income and transfers to abroad (net foreign income)

The **capital account** records:
* Changes in financial liabilities and assets
* Sales and purchases of fixed assets

**International investment income** includes:
* Dividends and interest from direct and portfolio investments, loans and trade credits
* Direct investors' share of retained earnings

The benefits of **foreign direct investment** are:
* Provides an additional source of capital for economic development
* Access to markets through integration in international production networks
* Access to technology

**Net capital outflow** (NCO) refers to the purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents minus the purchase of domestic assets by foreigners. Net capital outflow per year equals total capital outflow minus total capital inflow during a year.

Variables that influence net capital outflow:
* The real interest rate being paid on foreign assets.
* The real interest rate being paid on domestic assets.
* The perceived economic and political risks of holding assets abroad.
* The government policies that affect foreign ownership of domestic assets.

$\text{National Saving}=\text{Domestic Investment}+\text{Net Capital Outflow}$


$\text{Current Account Balance}=\text{Net capital outflow}$

An **exchange rate** is the price at which one currency exchanges for another.

The **trade weighted index** (TWI) is a weighted average of currencies of major trading partners.

A **freely floating exchange rate** adjusts continuously to maintain equilibrium as demand and supply changes.

A **clean float** means there is no government or central bank intervention.

A **fixed exchange rate** is set at a pre-announced level or within a narrow band.

A **depreciation** or **devaluation** is a fall in the price of a free exchange rate or fixed exchange rate, respectively.

A **appreciation** or **revaluation** is a rise in the price of a free exchange rate or fixed exchange rate, respectively.

The **nominal exchange rate** is the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another. It is expressed in two ways; in units of foreign currency per one NZD or in units of NZD per one unit of the foreign currency.

The **real exchange rate** is the rate at which a country trades its goods and services with another country. It can be calculated as $\text{Real exchange rate}=\frac{\text{Nominal exchange rate}\times\text{Domestic price}}{\text{Foreign price}}$.

The **purchasing-power parity** is a theory that it some cost exactly the same to buy a foreign good with exchanging to the foreign currency as would buying it domestically.

The **law of one price** is that a good must sell for the same price in all locations.

**Arbitrage** is the process of taking advantage of differences in the prices in different markets.

Effects on the exchange rate and the interest rate are:
* Government budget deficits
* Trade policies
* Political and economic stability

A **trade policy** is a government policy that directly influences the quantity of goods and services that a country imports or exports. This includes:
* A **tariff** is a tax on an imported good.
* An **import quota** is a limit on the quantity of a good produced abroad and sold domestically.
* An **export subsidy** is a cash payment to exporters per unit of exports.

**Capital flight** is a large and sudden reduction in the demand for assets in a country.
